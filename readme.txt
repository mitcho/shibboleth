Allows WordPress to externalize user authentication and account creation to a
Shibboleth Service Provider.

== Description ==

This plugin is designed to support integrating your WordPress or WordPress MU
blog into your existing identity management infrastructure using a
[Shibboleth][] Service Provider.  

WordPress can be configured so that all standard login requests will be sent to
your configured Shibboleth Identity Provider or Discovery Service.  Upon
successful authentication, a new WordPress account will be automatically
provisioned for the user if one does not already exist.  User attributes
(username, first name, last name, display name, nickname, and email address)
can be synchronized with your enterprise's system of record each time the user
logs into WordPress.  

Finally, the user's role within WordPress can be automatically set (and
continually updated) based on any attribute Shibboleth provides.  For example,
you may decide to give users with an eduPersonAffiliation value of *faculty*
the WordPress role of *editor*, while the eduPersonAffiliation value of
*student* maps to the WordPress role *contributor*.  Or you may choose to limit
access to WordPress altogether using a special eduPersonEntitlement value.

== Installation ==

First and foremost, you must have the Shibboleth Service Provider [properly
installed][] and working.  If you don't have Shibboleth working yet, I assure
you that you won't get this plugin to work.  This plugin expects Shibboleth to
be configured to use "lazy sessions", so ensure that you have Shibboleth
configured with requireSession set to "false".  Upon activation, the plugin
will attempt to set the appropriate directives in WordPress's .htaccess file.
If it is unable to do so, you can add this manually:

    AuthType shibboleth
    Require shibboleth

The option to automatically login the users into WordPress also works when not
using the lazy session options as it will force login into WordPress. In other
words, if the user has an active session and you are requiring authentication
to access this WordPress site and they need to be logged into WordPress, then
they will be logged in without having to use the WordPress login page. 

This works very well for sites that use WordPress for internal ticketing and
helpdesk functions where any access to content requires authentication.
Consider the following .htaccess options when used in conjunction with the
automatic login feature

    AuthType shibboleth
    ShibRequestSetting requireSession 1
    Require valid-user

OR

    Authtype shibboleth
    ShibRequestSetting requireSession 1
    Require isMemberOf group1 group2
    Require sAMAccountName user1 user 2


NOTE: If the plugin is successful in updating your .htaccess file, it will
place the option between a marked block:

   BEGIN Shibboleth
   END Shibboleth

If you add more options, you may want to consider moving all configuration
options out of this block as they will be cleared out upon deactivation
of the plugin.

= For single-user WordPress =

Upload the `shibboleth` folder to your WordPress plugins folder (probably
`/wp-content/plugins`), and activate it through the WordPress admin panel.
Configure it from the Shibboleth settings page.

= For WordPress MU =

Shibboleth works equally well with WordPress MU using either vhosts or folders
for blogs.  Upload the `shibboleth` folder to your `mu-plugins` folder
(probably `/wp-content/mu-plugins`).  Move the file `shibboleth-mu.php` from
the `shibboleth` folder up one directory so that it is in `mu-plugins`
alongside the `shibboleth` folder.  No need to activate it, just configure it
from the Shibboleth settings page, found under "Site Admin".

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Shibboleth? =

From [the Shibboleth homepage][]: 

> The Shibboleth System is a standards based, open source software package for
> web single sign-on across or within organizational boundaries. It allows
> sites to make informed authorization decisions for individual access of
> protected online resources in a privacy-preserving manner.

= Can I extend the Shibboleth plugin to provide custom logic? =

Yes, the plugin provides a number of new [actions][] and [filters][] that can
be used to extend the functionality of the plugin.  Search `shibboleth.php` for
occurances of the function calls `apply_filters` and `do_action` to find them
all.  Then [write a new plugin][] that makes use of the hooks.  If your require
additional hooks to allow for extending other parts of the plugin, please
notify the plugin authors via the [support forum][].

Before extending the plugin in this manner, please ensure that it is not
actually more appropriate to add this logic to Shibboleth.  It may make more
sense to add a new attribute to your Shibboleth Identity Provider's attribute
store (e.g. LDAP directory), or a new attribute definition to the  Identity
Provider's internal attribute resolver or the Shibboleth Service Provider's
internal attribute extractor.  In the end, the Shibboleth administrator will
have to make that call as to what is most appropriate.
